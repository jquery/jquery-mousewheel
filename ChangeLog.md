# Mouse Wheel ChangeLog

## 3.2.0

* Use `.on()`/`.off()` for event binding where available
* Don't clobber mouse offset properties if we don't adjust them (#165)
* Remove moot `version` property from bower.json (#140)
* Remove the executable bit from the library (#176)
* Add jtr-based tests in GitHub Actions, migrate to ESLint flat config (#247)

## 3.1.13

* Update copyright notice and license to remove years
* Create the correct compressed version

## 3.1.9

* Fix bower.json file
* Updated how the deltas are adjusted for older mousewheel based events that have deltas that are factors of 120.
* Add $.event.special.mousewheel.settings.adjustOldDeltas (defaults to true) to turn off adjusting of old deltas that are factors of 120. You'd turn this off if you want to be as close to native scrolling as possible.

## 3.1.8

* Even better handling of older browsers that use a wheelDelta based on 120
* And fix version reported by `$.event.special.mousewheel`

* Attempt to better handle older browsers that use a wheelDelta based on 120

## 3.1.6

* Deprecating `delta`, `deltaX`, and `deltaY` event handler arguments
* Update actual event object with normalized `deltaX `and `deltaY` values (`event.deltaX`, `event.deltaY`)
* Add `deltaFactor` to the event object (`event.deltaFactor`)
* Handle `> 0` but `< 1` deltas better
* Do not fire the event if `deltaX` and `deltaY` are `0`
* Better handle different devices that give different `lowestDelta` values
* Add `$.event.special.mousewheel.version`
* Some clean up

## 3.1.5
